The xmas-icetube case revision is a slightly modified version of the
Adafruit Ice Tube Clock v1.1 case that accommodates the xmas-icetube
circuit board.

The xmas-icetube case revision may be viewed and modified in Inkscape:

The custom-cut acrylic parts may also be ordered directly from my

The Ice Tube Clock case was originally designed by Amanda Wozniak
(w0z), and I have only made minor adjustments to her design.

Adafruit forum user Daygecko also deserves credit for finding clear
machine nuts and bolts from McMaster-Carr, which give the assembled
case a much cleaner look.
