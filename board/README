The xmas-icetube revision of the Adafruit Ice Tube Clock is discussed
in the following thread:

    http://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=41&t=43836

The included board files can be opened and and modified with Eagle,
which may be purchased or downloaded from CadSoft:

This revision (revision B) may also be ordered directly from OSH Park:

Note:  The main PCB and side PCB might not be separated by OSH Park,
so be prepared to cut those apart yourself.  In a future revision, the
boards will be divided into two separate projects to avoid this issue.
