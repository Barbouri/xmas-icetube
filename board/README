The included board files can be opened and and modified with Eagle,
which may be purchased or downloaded from CadSoft:

The current board (Rev. C) may be ordered directly from OSH Park:

Please note that although the Rev. C board seems to work well, voltage
across the IV-18 filament is too low.  Even so, voltage across the
filament is still better than in the original Adafruit design.  See
