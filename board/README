The current board (Rev. D) is *untested*, so use this design at your
own risk.  Rev. C includes an enhancement to the filament driver
circuit to increase voltage to within specifications.

The original Ice Tube Clock board was designed by Lady Ada of
Adafruit.  Her design is also available via GitHub:

The Adafruit Ice Tube Clock board was loosely based on the inGrid
IV-18 clock by Riad S. Wahby.  My xmas-icetube board revision is based
on the Adafruit Ice Tube Clock board by Lady Ada.

While creating the xmas-icetube board revision, I had fruitful
discussions with both Phil DeGruy (PhilD13) and Russ Walker
(Russell27), mostly in regard to how to properly drive the IV-18 tube.
Phil also took the time to review my design and suggest several
alternative components, which was especially helpful.

Because I am inexperienced in electronics design, I feel compelled to
add the following disclaimer:  Those cited in this section cannot be
faulted for any errors in my board revisions.
