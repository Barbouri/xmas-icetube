My father gave me an Ice Tube Clock kit from Adafruit as a Christmas gift last
year.  As an excuse to learn AVR programming, I started playing with the
software.  Eventually, none of the origional code remained and the project
became a feature-rich reimplementation of the original Adafruit firmware.

## Features ##
##############

This firmware boasts many features including,

    (1) adjustable alarm volume,
    (3) progressive alarming,
    (2) musical alarm ("Merry Christmas"),
    (4) DST support (USA, EU, or manual),
    (5) automatic drift correction,
    (6) alarm sounds during power outage,
    (7) no reset during power failure, and
    (8) autodimmer (requires photoresistor)

BUT, this firmware currently lacks GPS support, and
the drift correction is not well tested.  So use it
at your own risk.

For Ice Tube Clock hackers, this firmware has

    (1) compatibility with the atmega328p,
    (2) a pseudo object-oriented design,
    (3) reasonably good commenting, and
    (4) time/menus by finite state machine.

## Wish List ##
###############

(1) macro should explicitly enable brightness control

(2) set date by iso format "yyyy.mm.dd", not regional format

(3) GPS support

I am also thinking about different time and date formats, but am not sure if I
will actually do it.  The current display suits me quite well.  Currently, the
user may only select between 12 and 24 hour time display.

    "set tfmt"
        - toggle 24-hour mode	"hours 24"  "hours 12"
        - toggle am/pm:		"a/pm cir"  "a/pm dot"  "a/pm txt"  "a/pm off"
        - toggle seconds	"sec show"  "sec hide"
        - toggle showdst        "dst  cir"  "dst  dot"  "dst hide"

    "set dfmt"
        - toggle weekday        "wday  on"  "wday off"
        - date format		"date dmy"  "date mdy"  "date txt"  "date iso"
