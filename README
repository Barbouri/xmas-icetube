## xmas-icetube Project ##
##########################

The xmas-icetube project started as an alternative firmware for the
Adafruit Ice Tube clock, but now includes the xmas-icetube hardware
redesign.  The redesign includes an extensive revision of the main
board as well as slight modifications to the side board and case.

The xmas-icetube firmware runs on *both* the Adafruit Ice Tube Clock
v1.1 and the xmas-icetube redesign.  Since most users will be using
xmas-icetube on the Adafruit Ice Tube Clock v1.1, the default firmware
configuration is set for the Adafruit Ice Tube Clock v1.1 without any
hardware mods.  See the README file in the firmware directory for more
information on how to configure the xmas-icetube firmware.
