This firmware has several improvements over the original:

    (1) adjustable buzzer volume,
    (2) progressive alarm buzzer,
    (3) DST support (USA, EU, or manual),
    (4) automatic drift correction,
    (5) alarm sounds during power outage,
    (6) no reset during power outage, and
    (7) autodimmer with pull-up and photoresistor


For Ice-Tube-Hackers, this firmware has

    (1) compatibility with atmega328p,
    (2) pseudo object-oriented design,
    (3) reasonably good commenting, and
    (4) clock modes via finite state machine


Wish list:

(1) macro should explicitly enable brightness control

(2) set date by "yyyy.mm.dd"

(3) different time and date formats:
    "set tfmt"
        - toggle am/pm:		"a/pm cir"  "a/pm txt"
        - toggle seconds	"sec show"  "sec hide"
        - toggle 24-hour mode	"hours 24"  "hours 12"
        - toggle showdst        "dst show"  "dst hide"
        - toggle divider	"dots  on"  "dots off"

    "set dfmt"
        - toggle w-day          "wday  on"  "wday off"
        - date format		"date dmy"  "date mdy"  "date txt"  "date iso"

(4) time-from-gps support
