## xmas-icetube Clock ##
########################

The xmas-icetube clock is a revision of the Adafruit Ice Tube Clock v1.1,
but the software has been completely rewritten and the circuit board
extensively revised.  The case and overall look of the clock is nearly
identical to the original design, however.

The xmas-icetube firmware runs on *both* the Adafruit Ice Tube Clock v1.1
and the xmas-icetube revision.  Since most users will be using the
xmas-icetube firmware on the Adafruit Ice Tube Clock v1.1, the default
firmware configuration is set for the Adafruit clock with no hardware
modifications.  See the README file in the firmware directory for more
information on how to configure the xmas-icetube firmware.
