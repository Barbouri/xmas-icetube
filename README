## XMAS-ICETUBE CLOCK ##
########################

The xmas-icetube clock is a revision of the Adafruit Ice Tube Clock
v1.1, but the software has been completely rewritten and the circuit
board extensively revised.  The case and overall look of the clock is
nearly identical to the original design, however.

The xmas-icetube firmware runs on *both* the Adafruit Ice Tube Clock
v1.1 and the xmas-icetube revision.  Since most users will be using
the xmas-icetube firmware on the Adafruit Ice Tube Clock v1.1, the
default firmware configuration is set for the Adafruit clock with no
hardware modifications.  See the README file in the firmware/
directory for more information on how to configure and install the
xmas-icetube firmware.

ATmega328p lying around to program it with this firmware and use
it instead of the one that comes with the kit."
