My father gave me an Ice Tube Clock kit from Adafruit as a Christmas gift.
In an effort to learn AVR programming, I started playing with firmware.  The
result was a complete reimplementation of the original Adafruit firmware.

## Features ##
##############

This firmware boasts many features including,

    (1) adjustable buzzer volume,
    (2) progressive alarm buzzer,
    (3) DST support (USA, EU, or manual),
    (4) automatic drift correction,
    (5) alarm sounds during power outage,
    (6) no reset during power outage, and
    (7) autodimmer (requires photoresistor)

BUT, this firmware currently lacks GPS support, and
the drift correction is not well tested.  So use it
at your own risk.

For Ice Tube hackers, this firmware has

    (1) compatibility with the atmega328p,
    (2) a pseudo object-oriented design,
    (3) reasonably good commenting, and
    (4) display modes via finite state machine.

## Wish List ##
###############

(1) macro should explicitly enable brightness control

(2) set date by iso format "yyyy.mm.dd"

(3) GPS support

I am also thinking about different time and date formats, but am not sure if I
will actually do it.  The current display suits me quite well.

    "set tfmt"
        - toggle 24-hour mode	"hours 24"  "hours 12"
        - toggle am/pm:		"a/pm cir"  "a/pm dot"  "a/pm txt"  "a/pm off"
        - toggle seconds	"sec show"  "sec hide"
        - toggle showdst        "dst  cir"  "dst  dot"  "dst hide"

    "set dfmt"
        - toggle weekday        "wday  on"  "wday off"
        - date format		"date dmy"  "date mdy"  "date txt"  "date iso"
