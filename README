Implemented features:

(1) fine volume adjustment


Basic clock still needs:

(1) show day-of-week and date on button press when displaying time

(2) date format select

(3) time format select


Desired extra features:

(1) Shorten the snooze time so I don't fall asleep before the alarm goes off again.  Changing the snooze time is easy, but figuring out the ideal snooze time for me is requiring some trial and error...

(2) progressive alarm

(3) Automatically adjust for the clock running too fast or slow:  If you set the clock time, and set the time again a week later, the clock can figure out if it's running fast or slow...and adjust it's timekeeping accordingly!

(4) Lower power consumption when clock sleeps:  When the power goes out, the clock goes to sleep and runs on the internal battery.  Currently the battery lasts two weeks, but in theory it could last years.  All I need to do is shut
down the watchdog timer, analog comparator and maybe some other features.  Analog comparator could be enabled on tick to detect when power is restored.

(5) Alarm should still function even if on battery power only.

(6) Automatic adjustment for daylight savings time in US.

(7) Brightness adjustment based on ambient light
