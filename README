## XMAS-ICETUBE PROJECT ##
###########################

Several years ago, my father gave me an Adafruit Ice Tube Clock kit as a
Christmas gift.  As an excuse to learn AVR programming, I started playing
with the code, and eventually, none of the original Adafruit code remained.
The result was a feature-rich reimplementation of the Adafruit firmware.

Once the firmware was mature, I decided to revise the hardware design to
support many of the hardware modifications from various Ice Tube Clock
users and myself.  With the help of other clock hackers, especially Phil
DeGruy and Russell Walker, the xmas-icetube hardware revision became a
reality.

The xmas-icetube firmware still runs on the Adafruit Ice Tube Clock v1.1 as
well as the xmas-icetube hardware revision.  For more information on the
firmware and hardware portions of this project, please read the README
files in the firmware/ and hardware/ directories.

Finally, the xmas-icetube project is named after Christmas, but is designed
for use year-round.  And the name is a reference to Christmas as a cultural
holiday--not a religious holiday.  The project is intended to be compatible
with all religions.

ATmega328p lying around to program it with this firmware and use
it instead of the one that comes with the kit."

"+10 for John's firmware!  Please do not let the 'xmas' name sway
you from giving it a try. It's the most feature complete Ice-Tube
Clock firmware to date."

## FEATURES ##
##############

On an unmodified Adafruit Ice Tube Clock v1.1, the xmas-icetube firmware
offers the following improvements over the official Adafruit firmware:

  - animated display transitions
  - fully automatic compensation for clock drift
  - multiple time and date formats
  - pulsing display brightness during alarm and snooze
  - three alarm times for selectable days of the week
  - functional alarm during power outage*
  - finely adjustable alarm volume (from 0 to 10)
  - progressive alarm option (gradually increasing volume)
  - selectable alarm sound (high frequency beeps, low frequency beeps, high
    frequency three beep pulse, low frequency three beep pulse, Merry
    Christmas, Big Ben, Reveille, or For He's a Jolly Good Fellow)
  - adjustable snooze duration
  - DST support (USA, EU, or manual)
  - 4-fold improvement in battery life
  - no beeping or time loss after external power failure
  - low battery warning before battery failure
  - per-digit brightness adjustment for uneven displays
  - optionally disable display during specified time periods

* Without external power, the alarm sounds with loud high frequency
  beeps.  The only way to turn the alarm on or off is with the alarm
  switch.  Snooze is not supported.

With hardware modification of the Adafruit Ice Tube Clock v1.1, the
xmas-icetube firmware supports the following additional features:

  - GPS synchronized timekeeping*
  - highly accurate temperature compensated timekeeping
  - automatic brightness control by ambient light
  - optionally disable display at night (when dark)
  - 25-fold improvement in battery life
  - IV-18 tube driven to specifications

* An external GPS module, such as the Adafruit Ultimate GPS, is necessary
  to support GPS synchronized timekeeping.

The xmas-icetube hardware revision provides hardware support for all of the
features mentioned above.  For connecting an optional GPS module, the
hardware revision provides labeled through-hole solder points.
