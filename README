Improvements over original firmware

(1) refined volume adjustment
(2) alarm works during sleep


Wish List:

(1) adjustable snooze [1-30]

(2) progressive alarm

(3) automatic drift correction

Automatically adjust for the clock running too fast or slow:  If you set the clock time, and set the time again a week later, the clock can figure out if it's running fast or slow...and adjust it's timekeeping accordingly!

(4) optimized power savings

Lower power consumption when clock sleeps:  When the power goes out, the clock goes to sleep and runs on the internal battery.  Currently the battery lasts two weeks, but in theory it could last years.  All I need to do is shut
down the watchdog timer, analog comparator and maybe some other features.  Analog comparator could be enabled on tick to detect when power is restored.

(5) DST adjustment

Automatic adjustment for daylight savings time in US.

(6) auto dimmer

Brightness adjustment based on ambient light.
